# 1. Create a new Account my_account with an initial balance of 1000 and account type "savings"
# 2. Deposit 200 to my_account using the deposit() method
# 3. Assert that my_account.balance equals 1200


def test_deposit():
    my_account = Account(1000, "savings")
    my_account.deposit(200)
    assert my_account.balance == 1200


# Exercise 1.3
